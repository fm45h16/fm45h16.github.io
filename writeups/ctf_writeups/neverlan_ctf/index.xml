      <description>Initial Foothold Nmap scan 1nmap -sC -sV -sS -oN nmap.out 10.10.104.143 Open ports:
 21 - vsftpd 3.0.2 22 - ssh 80 - httpd
 Port 80 We got a default apache2 webpage at port 80
Fuzzing the url with gobuster shows a folder /assets
We have a look at the css file and fine something interesting
We find a php file at /10.10.57.192/sup3r_s3cr3t_fl4g.php Going to the page pops up an alert to turn of javascript and redirects to a youtube page for the song found in RickRolled.</description>

 22 - SSH 80- http  We have a look at the webpage where it lets us view some dot or cat pictures
Having a look at the url, we see that the page is running a php that shows the pictures stored in the dogs/ or cats/ folder which passes the value &amp;ldquo;dog&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;cat&amp;rdquo; to the variable &amp;ldquo;view&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Task 1:  We use the usual nmap to scan the machine. Note that it says that the machine does not respond to ICMP requests. So, we have to use -Pn with nmap for scanning  nmap -sC -sV -Pn -oN nmap-out 10.10.221.176 The results:
# Nmap 7.80 scan initiated Wed Mar 25 10:26:26 2020 as: nmap -sC -sV -Pn -oN nmap.out 10.10.221.176 Nmap scan report for 10.10.221.176 Host is up (0.</description>

      <description>Task 1: 1. Deploy the machine and connect to our network We deploy the machine and connect to the vpn network using openvpn
sudo openvpn [your generated .ovpn file] 2. Find the services exposed by the machine We use our usual nmap scan with service detection for scanning:
nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap-out 10.10.174.122 Output:
# Nmap 7.80 scan initiated Wed Mar 25 00:13:59 2020 as: nmap -sC -sV -oN nmap-out 10.</description>

      <description>Preamble This guide shows how to passthrough a gpu to a vm running on QEMU/KVM on linux for improved graphical performance. In my case, I did it to run windows and play games while I can still work on my linux machine. Dual booting is not a good solution in this case as rebooting into windows just for the purpose of gaming is a pain. Passing through my gpu, I can switch between games and work with muxh ease.</description>

SOLUTION: We use gdb to solve this problem. We see that the file is an ELF 64-bit LSB shared object

      <description>Nana told me that buffer overflow is one of the most common software vulnerability. Is that true?
Download : http://pwnable.kr/bin/bof Download : http://pwnable.kr/bin/bof.c
Running at : nc pwnable.kr 9000
 Solution: We get the files and run the executable bof
1$./bof 2overflow me : 3AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA 4Nah.. 5$./bof 6overflow me : 7AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA 8Nah.. 9*** stack smashing detected ***: ./bof terminated 10Aborted The program asks for an input and on bufferoverflow, it detects stack smashing.</description>

      <description>Daddy told me about cool MD5 hash collision today. I wanna do something like that too!
ssh col@pwnable.kr -p2222 (pw:guest)
 Solution: We ssh with the given password and list the files in the directory
$ssh col@pwnable.kr -p2222 col@pwnable.kr&#39;s password: ____ __ __ ____ ____ ____ _ ___ __ _ ____ | \| |__| || \ / || \ | | / _] | |/ ]| \ | o ) | | || _ || o || o )| | / [_ | &#39; / | D ) | _/| | | || | || || || |___ | _] | \ | / | | | ` &#39; || | || _ || O || || [_ __ | \| \ | | \ / | | || | || || || || || .</description>

      <description>Mommy! what is a file descriptor in Linux?
 try to play the wargame your self but if you are ABSOLUTE beginner, follow this tutorial link: https://youtu.be/971eZhMHQQw  ssh fd@pwnable.kr -p2222 (pw:guest)
 Solution: This is the easiest of all the problems here. We login with via ssh with the given credentials and find 3 files.
$ssh fd@pwnable.kr -p2222 fd@pwnable.kr&#39;s password: ____ __ __ ____ ____ ____ _ ___ __ _ ____ | \| |__| || \ / || \ | | / _] | |/ ]| \ | o ) | | || _ || o || o )| | / [_ | &#39; / | D ) | _/| | | || | || || || |___ | _] | \ | / | | | ` &#39; || | || _ || O || || [_ __ | \| \ | | \ / | | || | || || || || || .</description>

      <description>I am a student currently studying Electronics Engineering, with a passion for cybersecurity and a thirst for tech stuff. This is my personal blog site, which I set up with a view to document my journey learning cybersecurity through articles on topics I learn. Besides the site will also hold some other tech stuff that I might be interested in and take up as a project.
One basic point of this site will be CTFs.</description>
